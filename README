Installation Guide
==================

This script will replicate my Arch Linux system configuration onto new machines.
See my dotfiles (https://github.com/thehnm/dotfiles) for more information.


Install Arch Linux Base System
------------------------------

Before you can use this script a basic Arch Linux installation is required since my script only configures an existing system.
The Arch Linux Installation Guide (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) lists instructions for setting up a basic installation.
However, this script will already configure some settings such as locales, timezones and networking.


Script
------

The next step after installing Arch Linux would be to download this script.

    > curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thehnm/tarbs/master/install.sh
    > bash install.sh


What this script will do
------------------------

- Setup timezone
- Setup locale
- Set hostname
- Setup user
- Install programs needed for my configuraton/workflow. See packages.csv for further information
- Install my dotfiles
